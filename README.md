Ryan Marshall's Homework 9 repository

There are three files for this homework located in the 'EmployeeSQL' folder: a 'QuickDBD-export' PNG image which shows the ERD, an 'Employee Schema' sql source file that contains the SQL commands for creating the database schema, and a 'Homework 9 Queries' sql source file that contains the queries I wrote to answer the homework questions.
